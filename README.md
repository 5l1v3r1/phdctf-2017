# PHDays CTF 2017

PHDays CTF is an online international challenge in the information security. Developer by Hackerdom team for PHDays forum.

The contest is driven by classic rules (Attack-Defense [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security))
Each team is given a set of vulnerable services.
Organizers regulary fill services with private information — the flags.
